4. **Team Contributions** — Who is delivering? How is work distributed across the team?

Additionally, analyze the pull requests alongside the issues:

7. **Issue-PR Linkage** — Which issues have corresponding PRs? Which PRs close/fix which issues? Are there orphaned issues (no PR) or orphaned PRs (no linked issue)?
8. **Test Coverage** — Which PRs include test files? Are tests proportional to the changes? Flag PRs that modify source code without adding/updating tests.
9. **Review Quality** — Are PRs being reviewed? What feedback patterns appear in reviews? Are reviews substantive or rubber-stamps?
10. **Resolution Verification** — For closed issues, does the linked PR's diff actually address the issue described? Flag any issues closed without a corresponding code change."""
