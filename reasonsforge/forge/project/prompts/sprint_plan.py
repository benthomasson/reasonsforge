## Instructions

Generate a sprint plan with these sections:

1. **Sprint Goal** — A one-sentence sprint goal that captures the highest-impact theme.

2. **Prioritized Backlog** (5-8 items) — Ranked by downstream beliefs unblocked and practical impact.
   For each item:
   - Issue ID and title
   - Why it is prioritized (which beliefs or conclusions does resolving it unblock)
   - Estimated effort (S/M/L based on issue complexity signals)
   - Suggested assignee with justification (capacity, expertise, bus-factor)

3. **Assignment Recommendations** — Who should work on what and why.
   Reference specific capacity signals (open issue count, recent velocity, expertise areas).
   Flag bus-factor risks where one person owns too much.

4. **Escalation Flags** — Items needing human authority decisions:
   - Unassigned critical/high-priority items
   - Stale blockers (no activity in 30+ days)
   - Cross-team dependencies
   - Staffing or re-prioritization decisions
   Be specific about what decision is needed and who should make it.

5. **Risk Summary** — Top 3-5 risks for this sprint:
   - What could go wrong
   - Likelihood signal from the data
   - Mitigation suggestion

Be concrete — reference issue IDs, belief IDs, team member names, and specific data points from the sections above. Do not invent information not present in the data.
